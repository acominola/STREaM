## STREaM - STochastic REsidential water end-use Model

This repository contains the code of **STREaM, the STochastic REsidential water end-use Model** developed by Andrea Cominola

**References**
- **STREaM** is fully presented and tested in "Cominola, A., Giuliani, M., Castelletti, A., Rosenberg, D. E., and Abdallah, A. M., (*under review*). Implications of data sampling resolution on water use simulation, end-use disaggregation, and demand management"
- **STREaM** derives from the prototype of stochastic simulation model presented in "Cominola, A., Giuliani, M., Castelletti, A., Abdallah, A. M., and Rosenberg, D. E., 2016. Developing a stochastic simulation model for the generation of residential water end-use demand time series. In Proceedings of the 8th International Congress on Environmental Modelling and Software (iEMSs 2016), Toulouse, FR, 10-14 July 2016."
